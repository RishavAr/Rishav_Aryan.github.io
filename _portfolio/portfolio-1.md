### 🔍 Overview
Built an embodied simulation framework to evaluate LLM-driven agents performing **real iOS actions** inside simulator environments, enabling behavioral evaluation beyond static benchmarks.

### 🚀 Key Contributions
- Designed JSON-based task schemas covering **50+ multi-step tasks** across Safari, Maps, Calendar, Files, and Settings  
- Orchestrated **GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5, Grok-2** for controlled cross-model behavioral comparison  
- Implemented **Reflexion + TextGrad feedback loops**, improving task completion by **8–10%** without fine-tuning
