ML research under extreme compute constraints, including distributed GPU infrastructure and robust evaluation pipelines.


# Publications

• Learning to Act Anywhere: Experience-Based Similarity for Universal Interface Agents..First Author, ACL 2026 Submission
training-free cross-platform UI agents using FAISS-based Elastic Visual Memory, achieving ~40% higher task success under interface
perturbations with 83 ms per-step latency.

• Multimodal Event Detection: Current Approaches and Defining the New Playground through LLMs and VLMs..Co-Author, NLDB
2025 , systematic evaluation of multimodal ED identifying failure modes of generative LLM/VLM approaches and conditions where
supervised fusion models outperform.

# Independent Research Projects


## Enough Thinking - Efficient Reasoning via RL-Driven Self-Adaptation 

• Frontier reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) exhibit "rumination," consuming excessive tokens on simple logic and increasing
inference costs.
• A base 0.5B LLM achieved a GSM8K accuracy of 0.20 and required 218 tokens per query without Induction of Explicit Verification.
• Engineered a proof-of-concept system to incentivize token efficiency and permanent weight-internalization of reasoning patterns
using limited compute (Google Colab).
• Implemented Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) from scratch to induce emergent reflection; designed a SEAL-inspired
self-edit loop utilizing LoRA and ReSTEM RL to "cache" logic into parameters.
• Improved accuracy to 0.30 (+50%) while reducing token overhead by 48% (218 → 112 tokens); deployed via Model Context Protocol
(MCP) for deterministic tool-use via API.


## NetGuard: Autonomous Multi-Agent Framework for NIST-Compliant Threat Detection 


• Real-time threat detection lacks automated coordination between analysis and NIST-compliant response.
• Manual log enrichment resulted in high "time-to-remediate" latency and inconsistent classification.
• Led the design of a serverless multi-agent system (Ingestor, Analyzer, Aggregator) for automated traffic analysis.
• Built modular agents using SecureGPT and AWS Lambda; implemented reflexion feedback loops for system self-improvement via
API calls.
• Achieved 94.5% accuracy across 6,000+ data points, demonstrating expertise in "model coordination".
Experience


# George Mason University Jul 2025 - Present


## Research Assistant --- Machine Learning & Reinforcement Learning

• Financial time-series data is highly non-stationary; standard RL policies often collapse or "overfit" during sudden market regime
shifts.
• Static PPO-based allocation models failed to maintain alpha when market volatility spiked. Baseline performance was limited to a
Sharpe ratio of ~0.85 – 0.95 and a Sortino ratio of ~1.10, with an alpha near +0.05 that vanished during regime changes.
• Engineered a regime-aware RL system capable of autonomously distinguishing between market states and deployed as a scalable
distributed system to ensure steerable and stable policy learning.
• Developed latent state representations using VAE + GMM and implemented hierarchical PPO-based policies with realistic risk
constraints, leveraging probability and statistics to optimize performance.
• Achieved a consistent Sharpe ratio of 1.23 and positive alpha of +0.23, satisfying the engineering rigor required for regulated
foundation models for deployment in products.

# Wall Street Quants Jul 2024 - Oct 2024

## Quantitative Research Intern

• Cryptocurrency markets exhibit extreme non-stationarity and "regime blindness," where standard momentum models frequently
collapse or suffer from excessive drawdown during sudden market reversals.
• Baseline trading models were achieving 18% annualized returns but lacked the volatility filters and calibration necessary to survive
high-variance periods across the top-10 crypto assets.
• Engineered and calibrated a suite of adaptive momentum and reversal strategies designed to balance high-yield returns with rigorous,
real-time risk management.
• Developed and backtested strategies using Python and software engineering best practices, implementing RSI and moving average
calibrations across thousands of simulated scenarios to identify the most stable parameters.
• Developed and backtested algorithmic trading strategies, applying statistics and calculus to boost annualized returns from 18% to
25% (+38% improvement) and improve the Sharpe ratio by 15%.

# Foxmula May 2022 - Jul 2022

## Machine Learning Intern

• HR analytics at scale often lack predictive depth, leading to reactive decision-making and significant "human-in-the-loop" latency
when identifying employee dissatisfaction or promotion eligibility.
• The department relied on manual data triage, costing 10+ hours weekly in analysis and failing to provide a structured pipeline for
proactive strategic initiatives.
• Developed and deployed an automated, end-to-end ML pipeline to identify key drivers of dissatisfaction and accurately predict
promotion pipelines with high interpretability.
• Implemented ensemble models (XGBoost, Stacking) and engineered specialized tenure and skill-gap features; automated the entire
deployment via AWS and TensorFlow.
• Achieved 90% precision (+15% improvement in accuracy) and saved 10+ hours weekly, transforming a manual bottleneck into an
automated, data-driven system.
