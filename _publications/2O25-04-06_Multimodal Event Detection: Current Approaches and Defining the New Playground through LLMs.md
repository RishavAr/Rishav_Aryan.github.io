excerpt: "🟢 Presented at NLDB 2025. Keywords: Multimodal Learning, Vision–Language Models, Disaster Detection. We present a systematic study of multimodal disaster event detection on social media, comparing supervised fusion models with LLM-based approaches; while LLMs are robust to noisy language, supervised multimodal systems remain more reliable for structured event classification."
