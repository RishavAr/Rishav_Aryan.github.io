This work proposes **Latent-to-Parameter Transfer (LPT)**, a framework that leverages internal latent representations of a frozen teacher model to generate task-specific low-rank parameter updates for a student model. Unlike text-conditioned adapter generation, LPT exploits the **high-dimensional geometry of the teacher’s reasoning process**, enabling more faithful logic transfer. 

_Code and preprint will be released upon submission._
